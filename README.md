# PythonTextAdventure
A text adventure game written in Python

Just for fun as I need to learn Python for work. Written in Python 3.9.13, just cause that's what I had installed.

To run, run main.py.

This is a still a work in progress.

Eventually this should be easily alterable into your your own game!
